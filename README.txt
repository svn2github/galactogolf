About this project & the author
-------------------------------

I work at Google, in an area unrelated to Android. This is a project I have written in my spare time that Google have been kind enough to let me open source, therefore don't expect this to be a shining example of how to write an Android game, i.e. It's probably full of stupid code, poor architectural decisions and bugs :-)
